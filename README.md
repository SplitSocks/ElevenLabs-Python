# ElevenLabs-Python
Crafted GUI for ElevenLabs via Python scripting.

I am a fledgling scripter. I barely understand what I am doing.

This python script is being developed strictly for Fallout 4 voice lines. It could easily be used for other machinations. 
Let me know any ideas that I can add.


open cmd in folder type python tts_window.py
Everything should be self explanatory.

This is for converting Fallout 4 dialog exported to csv. 

CSV setup like
voice_id, text, out_path (any other headers here will be ignored)
EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL,"I like butts", .\000323
