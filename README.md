# ElevenLabs-Python
Crafting a GUI for ElevenLabs Useage.

I am a fledgling scripter. I thought ElevenLabs was friggin awesome so I wanted an easy to use GUI. I love Skyrim and Fallout 4 mods and hoped ElevenLabs would bring a new spark.

Currently, this GUI/script is for exported Dialouge lines from xEDIT or the CreationKit.

Download the repository.
Open cmd in folder type "python tts_window.py"

You may need to install a few pip libraries. I will eventually paste all that here. Forgive any slowness.

CSV setup is below. If any headers are missing, the script won't fire.

voice_id = The voice you want to use for this line. The GUI will allow you to pull a list of voices on your ElevenLabs account for easy retreival.
text = This is where you place the text you want parsed by ElevenLabs
out_path = I utilized the out_path for the name of the file when exported, so just put the name or w/e is exported to this column by the process.

voice_id, text, out_path
